How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?
I do this by taking a rigerous approach to writting code.  Start by eliciting requirements through speaking with whoever I'm writing the code for, sometimes this means reading documentation, doing research with end users or talking with project leads and asking any questions necessary until the requirements are clear and understood to make sure I have a full understanding of what the code needs to do along with any limitations it needs to obey, I then planning my code with an eye towards using object oriented principles and employing existing design patterns, From those two steps I can then stub out the classes and functions that I will need along with the unit tests that will be needed to confirm it fulfills the requirements and obeys the limititions initially set forward for it.  From there I can fully implement the code and its associated unit tests, including documentation.  Finally securing a peer review of my work prior to submission when possible and making sure the unit tests run and provide appropriate coverage of my code.
